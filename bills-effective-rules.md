# Bill's Effective Rules of Software Development

These rules are harsh, arbitrary, either ad-hoc or hocless. The numbers areneither ordered not guaranteed to be unique.

####Rule 14:
Projects built in Javascript often exhibit the semblance of being a [clusterfuck](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clusterfuck). This semblance may not be correct. (see Rule 36.)

####Rule 36:
Javascript is a hot mess. People who enjoy using the language will attempt to dispute this. To be honest, I don't think it's the language's fault: it's actually interesting and kind of cool in certain respects. However, its logical level is badly mismatched to the characteristic problem domain of web applications; and the combination of compulsory ubiquity, large numbers of enthusiastic implementers, and a high proportion of "throwaway" jobs has resulted in a regrettable body of practice.
